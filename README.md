# Stock-Portfolio Tracker - Server  

## Description: 
This repository is a server that is created using Node.js and Express.js. The server is a REST API server and interacts with a non-relational MongoDB database, which the server uses to store data about the users of the stock portfolio tracker
and their portfolios. 

So far, the server has been hosted on localhost:4000. 

A number of API testing was done on the server using Postman to varify that the server was responding to API requests as intended.
